# AVRProjects_StopWatch
Atmega_32_StopWatch Project


##Project description:
This project is made using the ATmega32 MCU using Embedded C language. It implements a simple Stop Watch with start, pause and reset buttons.

This project uses pushbuttons and 7-Segment displays to show the seconds and minutes. It can count up to 59 mins and 59 secs.

Attached is the .c file that contains the Embedded C code, and the .elf file to burn on the MCU.

The Proteus simulation for this project is also attached to show the pins connected.
